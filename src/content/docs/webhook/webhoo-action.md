In **undb**, once a webhook is created, several actions can be performed to manage and customize it according to your needs. These actions include enabling or disabling the webhook, duplicating it, deleting it, and renaming it.

## Key Webhook Actions

### 1. Enable/Disable Webhook

- **Enable/Disable**: You can toggle a webhook on or off without deleting it. Disabling a webhook temporarily stops it from sending notifications or triggering actions, which can be useful during maintenance or when you donâ€™t want the webhook to be active.

### 2. Duplicate Webhook

- **Create a Copy**: The duplicate action allows you to create an exact copy of an existing webhook, including its conditions and settings. This is useful when you want to set up a similar webhook with slight modifications, saving time on reconfiguration.

### 3. Delete Webhook

- **Remove the Webhook**: If a webhook is no longer needed, you can delete it. This permanently removes the webhook and stops all related notifications or actions.

### 4. Rename Webhook

- **Update Webhook Name**: You can rename a webhook to better reflect its purpose or the specific conditions it monitors. This is particularly helpful when managing multiple webhooks, ensuring that each one is clearly labeled.

## Summary

The **Webhook Actions** in **undb** give you flexibility in managing your webhooks, allowing you to enable, disable, duplicate, delete, or rename them as needed. These actions help you keep your webhook configurations organized and aligned with your project requirements.
