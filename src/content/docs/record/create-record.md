In **undb**, creating a record is a straightforward process that involves filling out the necessary fields as defined by the table's schema. This guide walks you through the steps to create a new record using the grid view interface.

## Steps to Create a Record

### 1. Access the Grid View

- **Open the Table**: Navigate to the table where you want to create a new record.
- **Grid View**: Ensure that you are in the grid view, which provides a tabular representation of the records in the table.

### 2. Open the Create Record Modal

- **Create Button**: On the top nav bar of the grid view, click the **Create New Record**.

- **Modal Interface**: The modal provides a structured interface where you can enter data for each field in the record. This interface is designed to make data entry easy and intuitive.

### 3. Fill Out the Fields

- **Field Configuration**: The fields displayed in the modal correspond to the fields configured in the table schema. You will need to fill out each field according to its data type and any constraints that have been set.

- **Required Fields**: Fields that are marked as required will be indicated with a red asterisk (\*). These fields must be filled out before you can save the record. Required fields ensure that critical data is always captured.

- **Default Values**: Some fields may have default values pre-filled, depending on how the table schema is configured. These values can be changed if necessary.

### 4. Save the Record

- **Submit**: After filling out the necessary fields, click the **Save** or **Submit** button at the bottom of the modal to create the record. The new record will be added to the table and visible in the grid view.

- **Validation**: If any required fields are missing or if there are any validation errors, the modal will prompt you to correct them before the record can be saved.

## Summary

Creating a record in **undb** is a simple process that involves entering data into a modal form. The grid view's expand button provides quick access to this modal, and required fields are clearly marked to guide you through the process. Once saved, the new record becomes part of the table, ready for further use and analysis.
