# Bulk Updating Records

In **undb**, the **Bulk Update** feature allows you to efficiently update multiple records at once. This is particularly useful when you need to apply the same change across several entries, ensuring consistency and saving time.

## Steps to Perform a Bulk Update

### 1. Access the Bulk Update Option

- **Grid View**: Navigate to the table where you want to perform the bulk update. Ensure you are in the grid view, which displays all records in a tabular format.
- **Bulk Update Button**: Look for the **Bulk Update** button, typically located at the top of the grid view or within the batch actions menu. Click this button to begin the bulk update process.

### 2. Select Fields to Update

- **Field Selection**: After clicking the **Bulk Update** button, you will be prompted to select the fields you wish to update. You can choose one or more fields depending on your needs.

- **Enter New Values**: For each selected field, enter the new value that you want to apply to the records. This value will be applied to all records that meet the conditions you set in the next step.

### 3. Apply Conditions

- **Condition-Based Filtering**: To ensure that only specific records are updated, you can apply conditions. These conditions allow you to filter records based on their current values.

- **Set Conditions**: Use the condition builder to define the criteria that records must meet to be included in the bulk update. For example, you might choose to update only records where a specific field has a certain value.

### 4. Execute the Bulk Update

- **Review and Confirm**: After selecting the fields and setting the conditions, review the update details. Ensure that the correct records will be updated as intended.

- **Perform Update**: Click the **Update** button to apply the changes. The system will process the update, applying the new values to all records that meet the specified conditions.

### 5. Review the Results

- **Grid View Update**: Once the bulk update is complete, the grid view will automatically refresh to reflect the changes. Review the updated records to ensure that the changes have been applied correctly.

## Summary

The **Bulk Update** feature in **undb** allows you to efficiently update multiple records with new values, based on specific conditions. This powerful tool helps maintain consistency across your data, making it easier to manage large datasets effectively.
