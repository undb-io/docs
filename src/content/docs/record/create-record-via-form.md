In **undb**, records can be created not only through the grid view but also via forms. Using forms to create records provides enhanced flexibility and control over the data entry process, allowing for customization, default values, and logic-driven data entry.

## Key Features of Creating Records via Forms

### 1. Form-Based Record Creation

- **Form Tab**: When you create a form in the **Form** tab, it becomes a powerful tool for record creation. The form allows you to define how data should be entered, including which fields are required, what the default values are, and how the form should behave based on user input.

### 2. Dropdown Menu for Form Selection

- **Create Record Button**: After creating a form, the **Create Record** button in the grid view will include a dropdown menu. This dropdown allows you to choose from the available forms for creating a new record. Selecting a form from this menu ensures that the record is created according to the specific configuration and logic defined in that form.

### 3. Customized Data Entry

- **Form Configuration**: The fields presented in the form are based on the tableâ€™s schema but can be customized in the form builder. You can decide which fields are visible, which are required, and what the default values should be. This customization ensures that the data entry process aligns with your specific needs.

- **Logic Forms**: Forms can include conditional logic, allowing certain fields to be shown or hidden based on previous inputs. This makes the data entry process more intuitive and reduces the likelihood of errors by guiding the user through a logical flow of data entry.

### 4. Default Values and Automation

- **Preset Values**: Forms allow you to preset default values for fields, streamlining the data entry process. When a record is created through a form, these default values are automatically applied, ensuring consistency across your data.

### 5. Seamless Integration with Record Management

- **Automatic Record Creation**: Once the form is filled out and submitted, a new record is automatically created in the table. This record is fully integrated with the rest of the data in **undb**, ready for further use, analysis, or updates.

## Summary

Creating records via forms in **undb** offers a powerful alternative to the traditional grid view method. By using forms, you can customize the data entry process to meet your specific requirements, ensure data integrity with logic-based forms, and streamline record creation with default values. This method is particularly useful for complex data entry scenarios where control and customization are essential.
