In **undb**, deleting a record is a straightforward process that allows you to remove data that is no longer needed. This helps keep your tables clean, relevant, and manageable by eliminating outdated or unnecessary entries.

## Steps to Delete a Record

### 1. Access the Record

- **Grid View**: Navigate to the table where the record you want to delete is located. Ensure you are in the grid view, where all records are displayed in a tabular format.
- **Select Record**: Locate the specific record you wish to delete. You can select the record directly in the grid view.

### 2. Delete the Record

- **Confirmation**: Upon selecting the delete option, you may be prompted to confirm the deletion. This step ensures that records are not accidentally removed.
