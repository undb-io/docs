## Sharing in undb

In undb, you can easily share Base, View, and Form with others through multiple sharing options. The sharing functionality allows you to copy the URL, generate a QR code, obtain an iframe code, and retrieve the Share ID. Here's how you can use these sharing features:

### Sharing Options

1. **Copy URL**:

   - When you share a Base, View, or Form, undb generates a unique URL. You can copy this URL directly to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button next to the URL.

2. **Generate QR Code**:

<img src="/imgs/share/share-qr-code.png" alt="share-qr-code" />

- A QR code representing the shareable URL can be generated. Click the "Copy" button next to the QR code option to copy the QR code image or its link to your clipboard, making it easy to share via mobile devices.

3. **Obtain iframe Code**:

   - You can embed the shared Base, View, or Form into another webpage using an iframe. The iframe code is provided and can be copied to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button next to the iframe option.

4. **Retrieve Share ID**:
   - Each shared item (Base, View, or Form) has a unique Share ID. This ID can be copied by clicking the "Copy" button next to the Share ID option.

### How to Share

1. Go to the Base, View, or Form you wish to share.
2. Click the "Share" button to open the sharing options.
3. Choose the sharing method you prefer (URL, QR code, iframe, or Share ID).
4. Click the corresponding "Copy" button to copy the selected option to your clipboard.

This sharing feature in undb allows seamless collaboration and easy distribution of your work across different platforms.
