In **undb**, the **Long Text** type field is designed to store larger amounts of text data. This field type is ideal for situations where you need to capture detailed information, such as descriptions, comments, or other extensive textual content.

## Key Features of Long Text Type

### 1. Large Text Storage

- **Text Data**: The Long Text type is specifically designed to hold extensive blocks of text. It's perfect for storing information like detailed descriptions, notes, or any other content that requires more space than a simple string field.

### 2. Default Value

- **Setting a Default Value**: When creating a Long Text field, you can define a default value. This value will automatically populate the field when a new record is created, unless another value is provided. This feature is useful when a common starting text is required for every entry.

### 3. Rich Text Option

- **Allow Rich Text**: An optional feature for the Long Text field is the ability to enable rich text formatting. If this option is selected, users can apply formatting to the text, such as bold, italics, lists, and links. This is especially useful for fields where the presentation of the text is important, such as in reports or detailed descriptions.

### 4. Display Field

- **Setting as Display Field**: Although less common for Long Text fields due to the amount of content they contain, you can still set a Long Text field as a display field if needed. This might be useful in scenarios where a detailed description is the primary identifier for a record.

## Use Cases

- **Detailed Descriptions**: Capture comprehensive descriptions of products, projects, or other items.
- **Comments/Notes**: Store user comments, feedback, or notes that require more space than a simple string.
- **Reports**: Use for writing or storing detailed reports, summaries, or articles where formatting might be required.

By using the Long Text type field in **undb**, you can effectively manage and present large blocks of text data, with the added flexibility of rich text formatting if needed.
