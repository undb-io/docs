In **undb**, the **Date** type field is designed to store and manage date-related data. This field type is essential for tracking events, scheduling, and organizing data based on time-sensitive information.

## Key Features of Date Type

### 1. Date Storage

- **Date Values**: The Date field is used to store calendar dates. This can include dates for events, deadlines, creation dates, or any other type of time-based data.

### 2. Display Format

- **Customizable Formats**: Dates can be displayed in various formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY) depending on your preferences or regional standards. This ensures that the data is presented in a way that is most intuitive for your users.

### 3. Constraints

Date fields in **undb** can include several constraints to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the data:

- **Required**: You can specify whether the Date field is mandatory. If set as required, every record must include a valid date before it can be saved.
- **Minimum Date**: Set a minimum allowable date to ensure that dates entered are not earlier than a specific threshold (e.g., no dates before the year 2000).
- **Maximum Date**: Similarly, you can set a maximum date to prevent future dates beyond a certain point, which is useful for planning or historical data.

### 4. Default Value

- **Setting a Default Date**: You can define a default date for the field, such as the current date, a specific fixed date, or no date at all. This default value will populate the field when a new record is created unless a different date is specified.

### 5. Use Cases

- **Event Scheduling**: Use the Date field to track when events are scheduled to occur, such as meetings, appointments, or project milestones.
- **Historical Records**: Store creation dates, modification dates, or any other significant historical data points.
- **Deadlines and Due Dates**: Manage deadlines by setting dates for tasks, assignments, or other time-sensitive activities.

By utilizing the Date type field in **undb**, you can effectively manage time-based data, ensuring that all your records are accurately tracked and easily accessible based on their date attributes.
