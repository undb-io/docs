### Button Field

The `button` field type in 'undb' provides a way to trigger updates to multiple other fields with a single click. It is a versatile field that can be configured with various options to suit your needs.

#### Key Features:

- **No Value**: The `button` field does not have a value.
- **Multiple Field Updates**: When clicked, the button can be configured to update multiple other fields within the same record.
- **Customizable Label**: You can configure the label of the button. If no label is set, the default text "Button" will be displayed.
- **Confirmation Dialog**: You can configure whether a confirmation dialog should appear before the button's actions are executed.
- **Not Displayed in Forms**: The `button` field type does not support being displayed in forms.

This field is particularly useful for actions that require user interaction within a grid view but do not need to be available in form views.
