In **undb**, the **Checkbox** type field is a simple and intuitive way to capture binary dataâ€”typically representing true/false, yes/no, or on/off values. This field type is ideal for scenarios where a straightforward selection or indication is needed.

## Key Features of Checkbox Type

### 1. Binary Data Storage

- **True/False Values**: The Checkbox field is used to store binary values. When a checkbox is selected, it typically represents a `true` or `yes` value, and when unselected, it represents `false` or `no`.

### 2. Display Format

- **Checkbox Interface**: In the user interface, this field is displayed as a simple checkbox that can be toggled on or off, making it easy for users to quickly indicate their choice.

### 3. Default Value

- **Setting a Default State**: You can define the default state of the checkbox when a new record is created. This could be either checked (true) or unchecked (false), depending on what makes the most sense for your data entry process.

### 4. Constraints

- **Required**: Although less common for checkboxes, you can specify whether the Checkbox field is required, meaning that a user must make an explicit choice (either true or false) before saving the record.

### 5. Use Cases

- **Status Indicators**: Use the Checkbox field to indicate whether a task is complete, a feature is enabled, or a condition is met.
- **User Preferences**: Capture user settings or preferences, such as opting in or out of communications, agreeing to terms, or enabling features.
- **Simple Yes/No Questions**: Use checkboxes to answer simple yes/no questions in forms or surveys.

By utilizing the Checkbox type field in **undb**, you can capture simple binary choices efficiently, ensuring that your data reflects clear, actionable decisions.
