In **undb**, views allow you to customize how your data is displayed and interacted with. Creating a new view provides flexibility in how you manage and analyze your data within a table.

## Steps to Create a View

### 1. Access the Create View Option

- **Top Navigation Bar**: To create a new view, navigate to the top of the interface and click on the **add button** located on the nav bar. This button allows you to initiate the creation of a new view.

### 2. Configure Your View

- **Set Up View Details**: After clicking the add button, you will be prompted to configure your view. You can name your view and customize it by setting filters, sorting, selecting fields, and more.

- **Choose Your View Type**: Depending on your needs, you may also select the type of view you want to create, whether itâ€™s a grid view, calendar view, or another format that best suits your data.

### 3. View Placement in Navigation

- **Left-Side Navigation Panel**: Once created, all views, except the default view, will be displayed in the left-side navigation panel as a submenu under the table to which they belong. This makes it easy to switch between different views within the same table.

### 4. Managing Your Views

- **Default View**: Each table in **undb** comes with a default view that cannot be deleted. This view is always available and serves as the baseline configuration for your table.

- **Additional Views**: Any additional views you create will be listed in the left-side navigation, allowing for quick access and management of different perspectives on your data.

## Use Cases

- **Task Management**: Create a view for tasks due today, another for completed tasks, and another for tasks by priority, all accessible from the left-side navigation.
- **Sales Analysis**: Set up different views for quarterly sales, top-performing products, and regional sales, easily toggling between them to analyze data from various angles.
- **Project Tracking**: Use different views to track project milestones, team assignments, and resource allocations, each with its own configuration.

## Summary

Creating a new view in **undb** is a straightforward process that enhances your ability to manage and analyze data. With views displayed as submenus in the left-side navigation, you can easily switch between different data perspectives to suit your workflow.
