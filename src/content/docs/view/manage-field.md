In **undb**, the **Manage View Field** feature allows users to control the visibility of fields within a view. This functionality provides comprehensive control over which fields are displayed, including system fields, and allows users to reorder fields. Properly configuring the displayed fields not only improves data readability but can also enhance performance.

## Key Features of Manage View Field

### 1. Control Field Visibility

- **Show or Hide Fields**: Users can select which fields to display and which to hide using the manage view fields popup. By customizing the visible fields, you can simplify the view and focus on the most important data.

- **System Fields Control**: System fields are typically hidden by default, but users can choose to show or hide these fields. System fields include crucial metadata like `id`, `createdAt`, and others that provide important information about records.

### 2. Toggle All Fields

- **Bulk Actions**: The manage view fields popup offers options to show or hide all fields at once. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of fields and needing to quickly adjust the view.

### 3. Field Reordering

- **Customize Field Order**: Users can drag and drop fields to reorder them, ensuring that data is arranged according to their logical needs. This makes the data display more intuitive and easier to understand.

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Selective Field Display**: In **undb**, selecting fewer fields to display in a view can improve system performance. This is because reducing the amount of data loaded and rendered speeds up data processing.

### 5. Use Cases

- **Project Management**: In a task management view, users might choose to display only key fields like task name, due date, and assignee while hiding less frequently used fields.
- **Sales Analysis**: In a sales data view, showing only product name, sales amount, and sales date fields helps to quickly focus on key metrics.
- **Inventory Management**: For inventory views, hiding unnecessary fields and displaying only stock quantity, product name, and supplier information can streamline the view and improve load times.

## Summary

The **Manage View Field** feature in **undb** is a powerful tool that allows users to optimize their views by controlling which fields are displayed and in what order. Proper management of view fields can significantly enhance data readability and improve system performance.
