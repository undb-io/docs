In **undb**, the **View Sort** feature allows you to organize data within a view by arranging rows based on the values in specific fields. Sorting helps you to prioritize and analyze data more effectively by displaying it in a meaningful order.

## Key Features of View Sort

### 1. Sorting by Fields

- **Field-Based Sorting**: You can sort the data in a view based on the values of a specific field. For example, you might sort tasks by their due date, customers by their last interaction date, or products by their price. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order, depending on your needs.

### 2. Handling Non-Sortable Fields

- **Non-Sortable Fields**: It’s important to note that not all fields in **undb** are sortable. Some fields, due to their data type or the way they are configured, cannot be used as the basis for sorting. For instance, complex data types like JSON or certain multi-select fields may not support sorting.

### 3. Use Cases

- **Task Management**: Sort tasks by priority or due date to ensure that the most urgent tasks are addressed first.
- **Sales Data**: Sort sales records by amount or date to analyze trends over time or identify top-performing products or salespeople.
- **Inventory Management**: Sort inventory by quantity to quickly identify low-stock items that may need to be reordered.

### 4. Easy Configuration

- **Configuring Sort**: Setting up sorting in a view is straightforward. You simply select the field you wish to sort by and choose whether to sort in ascending or descending order. If a field is non-sortable, **undb** will indicate that it cannot be used for sorting.

## Summary

The **View Sort** feature in **undb** provides a simple yet powerful way to organize data within your views by sorting rows based on field values. While most fields support sorting, it’s important to be aware that some fields are non-sortable due to their nature.
