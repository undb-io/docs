In **undb**, a **Base** is a collection of tables that together form a structured dataset within a Space. Bases help you organize related data, making it easier to manage and access information across your projects.

## Key Features of Base

### Unique Naming

- **No Duplicate Names**: Each Base within a Space must have a unique name. This helps in avoiding confusion and ensures that each Base can be easily identified and referenced within the Space.

<div class="p-4 mb-4 text-sm text-yellow-800 rounded-lg bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-yellow-300" role="alert">
  Base name should not contain special characters or spaces.
</div>

### Base Homepage Overview

When you open a Base, you are greeted with a homepage that provides all the tools you need to manage your tables:

1. **Create Table Button**:

   - This button allows you to create new tables within the Base. A table is where your data is stored in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet.

2. **Import Table Button**:

   - You can also import existing tables into the Base. This feature is useful for bringing in data from other sources or migrating tables from different projects.

3. **Tables List**:
   - The homepage displays a list of all the tables currently within the Base. This list provides quick access to your tables, allowing you to view and manage your data easily.

## Managing Your Base

- **Creating Tables**: You can create as many tables as needed within a Base to store different types of data. Each table can be customized to suit the specific data structure you require.

- **Importing Tables**: If you have data from other sources, the import function allows you to seamlessly integrate it into your Base, making it part of your **undb** workspace.

- **Navigating Tables**: The tables list on the Base homepage provides a clear overview of all your data assets within the Base, making navigation simple and intuitive.

By organizing your data into Bases within **undb**, you can maintain a clear structure and ensure that related data is kept together, enhancing both organization and accessibility.
