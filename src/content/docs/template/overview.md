**undb** allows you to quickly set up your workspace by importing pre-built templates. These templates can be imported into your own space, providing a ready-made structure for your data and projects.

## Steps to Import a Template

### 1. Access the Template Library

- **Template URL**: Visit the [undb template library](https://template.undb.io) to browse and select from a variety of pre-built templates available for import.

### 2. Choose a Template

- **Browse Templates**: Explore the available templates that best match your needs. Each template includes a predefined set of tables, fields, and optionally, data.

- **Select a Template**: Click on the template you wish to import. This will open a window where you can customize the import options before proceeding.

### 3. Configure the Import

- **Select Target Space**: Use the dropdown menu to choose the space within your **undb** account where the template should be imported. This ensures that the template is organized into the appropriate workspace.

- **Import Data Option**: Decide whether to include the templateâ€™s data during the import. If you choose to import the data, all records associated with the template will be added to your space along with the structure. However, please note that if you opt to copy the data, any user and attachment content within the template will be automatically deleted during the import process. If you prefer to start with a clean slate, you can choose to import just the structure without the data.

### 4. Import the Template

- **Confirm Import**: After configuring your preferences, confirm the import. The template, along with its selected data (if applicable), will be imported into your chosen space.

### 5. Review and Customize

- **Review Imported Content**: Once the import is complete, navigate to the space where you imported the template. Review the tables, fields, and data to ensure everything is set up as expected.

- **Customize**: You can now customize the imported template to better suit your needs, whether by adding new fields, modifying existing ones, or integrating it with other parts of your **undb** workspace.

## Summary

Importing a template in **undb** is a fast and efficient way to set up your workspace with predefined structures and data. By selecting a template and customizing the import options, you can quickly create a foundation for your projects within your chosen space, saving time and ensuring consistency across your work.
