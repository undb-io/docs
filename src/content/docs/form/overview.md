In **undb**, the **Form** feature is a powerful tool that allows both internal users and external participants to create data records. Forms are highly customizable, making them ideal for various data entry scenarios.

## Key Features of Forms

### 1. Internal and External Data Creation

- **Internal Use**: Forms can be used by your team to create new data records within **undb**, ensuring that data is entered consistently and accurately.
- **External Sharing**: You can also share forms with external users, allowing them to submit data directly into your **undb** tables. This is particularly useful for gathering information from clients, customers, or other stakeholders without requiring them to have access to your system.

### 2. Form Builder

- **Field Visibility**: The form builder allows you to control which fields are visible on the form. This helps streamline the data entry process by showing only the relevant fields to the user.
- **Required Fields**: You can set specific fields as required, ensuring that critical information is always captured when the form is submitted.
- **Logic Forms with Conditions**: Using conditions, you can create logic forms that dynamically show or hide fields based on user inputs. This makes the form more interactive and ensures that users only see fields that are relevant to their entries.
- **Default Values**: Fields can be pre-configured with default values, reducing the amount of data users need to enter and ensuring consistency in the data that is collected.

## Use Cases

- **Client Intake Forms**: Share a form with clients to gather essential information before a meeting or project start.
- **Employee Onboarding**: Use forms internally to collect new employee details, with logic conditions ensuring that only relevant fields are shown based on the role or department.
- **Event Registrations**: Create a form to allow external participants to sign up for events, with required fields capturing all necessary details.

## Summary

The **Form** feature in **undb** provides a flexible and powerful way to gather data both internally and externally. With the ability to customize fields, apply logic through conditions, and set default values, forms help ensure that data is collected efficiently and accurately.
