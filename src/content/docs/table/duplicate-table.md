In **undb**, duplicating a table allows you to create an exact copy of an existing table, including all of its data and relationships. This feature is particularly useful when you need to replicate a table's structure and content for testing, backup, or creating variations of the data.

## Steps to Duplicate a Table

### 1. Access the Table

- **Navigate to the Table**: First, navigate to the table you want to duplicate. Ensure that the table contains the data and structure you wish to replicate.

### 2. Duplicate the Table

- **Duplicate Option**: Locate the option to duplicate the table, typically found in the table's settings or context menu. Click on this option to begin the duplication process.

- **Confirm Duplication**: You may be prompted to confirm that you want to duplicate the table. Confirming this action will create a new table with the same structure and data as the original.

### 3. Data and Structure Replication

- **Data Copying**: All records from the original table will be copied to the new table. This includes all fields, values, and configurations.

- **Reference Fields**: If the original table contains reference fields (columns that link to other tables), a new column will be created in the related table to maintain the relationship. This ensures that the data integrity and relationships are preserved in the duplicated table.

### 4. Review the Duplicated Table

- **New Table**: Once the duplication process is complete, a new table will appear in your workspace with all the data and relationships intact. You can rename this table and modify it as needed, while the original table remains unchanged.

## Summary

Duplicating a table in **undb** is a powerful way to create exact copies of your data and structure. This feature not only replicates all the records but also ensures that relationships between tables are maintained by creating new columns in related tables. Whether for testing, backups, or data manipulation, table duplication provides a flexible tool for managing your data.
